      <p>My Letter to You 💌

Hey you,

It’s weird trying to fit years of love and memories all the way from ss1 into one message, but here I am  because I miss you. Like, genuinely. Not just “oh I thought of you today” miss you I mean I miss your presence, your voice, your calm, your chaos, all of it.

You’ve been my constant through everything when life got loud, when people switched up, when I didn’t even know who I was anymore. You were still there, quietly reminding me that I mattered. You’ve seen me in all my versions  broken, stubborn, confused, laughing till my stomach hurt  and you never once made me feel like too much or not enough. You just… stayed.

And that means more to me than you’ll ever realize.

Sometimes I replay moments in my head the random talks, the inside jokes no one else would ever get, the way we’d drift into conversations that made time stop. You’ve been the person who made “home” feel like a person, not a place.

So, even with distance, even with time moving too fast, I want you to know you’re still my person Arziki.  My favorite human.

Thank you for being there when I didn’t even know how to ask for it. Thank you for never treating my silence like distance. Thank you for loving me in ways that healed things I didn’t know were broken.

Happy Birthday, my best one. You deserve the world and if I could, I’d wrap it up with a bow and hand it to you myself.

No matter where life takes us, please don’t ever forget this:
you’re irreplaceable, and you’ve left a mark on me that no time or space can fade.

Always,
Twinn 💗 </p>
